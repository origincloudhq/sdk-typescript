# `bump` sets it to the next version after the newest tag: a minor version
# when the API moved (before 1.0 a minor version may change the API
# incompatibly, as the preview APIs may), a patch otherwise. A version that
# is already newer than that, a bump not released yet, stays. The
# regeneration workflow bumps it in its pull request, and the release
# workflow tags it once that is merged.
